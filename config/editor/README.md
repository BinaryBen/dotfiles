# Editor Config

> In the docs below, *Code* refers to [the open-source project by Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) as well as other projects that are based on the source code of *Code*. This includes VSCode, Codium.
> 
> Where documentation is relevant to a specific *Code* distribution (i.e. VSCode or Codium, but not both), it will be noted. Otherwise assume the docs refer to both VSCode and Codium.
> 
> In most cases, any reference to VSCode will also apply to GitHub Workspaces and references to Codium will apply to Code Server.

Usually I prefer to use Code or Micro as my default `$EDITOR` of choice.

## Code

Settings and extensions are managed using the [*Sync Settings*](https://open-vsx.org/extension/zokugun/sync-settings) extension. This was chosen over using the built-in sync feature of *VSCode* because the sync feature is unavailable to run on non-Microsoft builds of *Code*.
