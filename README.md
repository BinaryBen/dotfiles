<strong>It is said that you are your dotfiles. Ergo, this is me. Welcome, make yourself at ::1.</strong><br />
<sub>A very opinionated and modern take on `~/.files`. Aimed at creating a personalised standard experience across various systems. Drop into a similar experience across desktops and servers (for container-based and remote development workflows mainly). Built using custom coded modules. Build your own dotfiles using all of them, or take only what you need.</sub>

## ‚ú® Modernise the Terminal

It is the 21st Century. We have [better ways of doing things](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix) now. Let's use them!

Most of these are installed via my Dropbear "droppings", however many are configured in this repo. Where it makes sense, the ~~legacy~~ POSIX commands have been aliased to use the modern equivilants instead, but only in interactive shells.

* Bat
* LSD
* Delta
* dust
* duf
* broot? (or LSD tree?)
