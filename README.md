## ‚ú® Modernise the Terminal

It is the 21st Century. We have [better ways of doing things](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix) now. Let's use them!

Most of these are installed via my Dropbear "droppings", however many are configured in this repo. Where it makes sense, the ~~legacy~~ POSIX commands have been aliased to use the modern equivilants instead, but only in interactive shells.

* Bat
* LSD
* Delta
* dust
* duf
* broot? (or LSD tree?)
* fd
* ripgrep
