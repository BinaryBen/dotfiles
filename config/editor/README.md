# Editor Config

> In the docs below, *Code* refers to [the open-source project by Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) as well as other projects that are based on the source code of *Code*. This includes desktop variants: *[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)* and *[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)*; and browser-based variants: *[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)* and *[OpenVSCode Server](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server)*.
>
> Where documentation is relevant to a specific *Code* distribution (i.e. *VSCode* or *VSCodium*, but not both), it will be noted. Otherwise assume the docs refer to all derivatives of *Code*.

To put it as simply as possible, I usually prefer to use Code as my default IDE and Micro as my default `$EDITOR`. Sometimes I1 also play with Neo/Vim.

## Code

I tend to install both Codium *and* VSCode now. This is because if there is ever an issue with Codium, I rarely have the time to immediately fix it and need something I can drop into and keep working right away. This does mean though that I need to spend some time ensuring both editors behave similarly when setting up my dotfiles. That said, Codium is usually pretty rock solid, and I have found alternative ways (read: FOSS extensions üí™) to get 99% feature parity across both editors.

### Getting started

Install the Sync Settings extension by Zokugun

```bash
$ codium --install-extension zokugun.sync-settings
# or
$ code --install-extension zokugun.sync-settings
```

From within Code, open the command palette and run:

```bash
> Sync Settings: Open the repository settings
```

Edit and save the file with the following (replace `$DOTFILES` with the local path to this repo as the extension does not expand `$ENV_VARIABLES`):

```yaml
# hostname: (optional)
profile: main
repository:
  type: file
  path: $DOTFILES/config/editor
```

Then run this from the command pallette:

```bash
> Sync Settings: Download (repository -> user)
```

> **Note**
> You probably want to make a coffee ‚òïÔ∏è after running the last command. You can see logs of what it is doing under the Output tab (Shared).

> **Warning**
> Do not restart the editor from the Monkey Patch notification. It will still be installing more extensions and will automatically restart on its' own.

### Features:

- [x] Live share (pair/mob programming support)
- [x] Remote SSH / Container
- [x] Code Pair AI (via [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/)[^pair])
- [x] Synced settings without ties to one cloud provider
- [x] Support for "profiles" based on persona (home vs. work) and workspace languages [^profiles]
- [ ] **Git platforms integration**
  - [x] GitHub
  - [x] Gitlab
  - [x] Atlassian
  - [ ] Gitea
- [ ] **Comprehensive languages support**
  - [ ] Syntax highlighting
  - [ ] [Test integrations](https://github.com/hbenl/vscode-test-explorer#test-adapters)
  - [ ] Integrated debugging
  - [ ] Linting

> Settings and extensions are managed using the [*Sync Settings*](https://open-vsx.org/extension/zokugun/sync-settings) extension. This was chosen over using the built-in sync feature of *VSCode* because the sync feature is unavailable to run on non-Microsoft builds of *Code* and is dependant on *GitHub*.

[^pair]: I may try to replace Tabnine with an open source alternative, but for now I am happy just being able to try something that can be used in various editors.

[^profiles]: More needs to be done on the profiles feature but it is largely workable for now. I need the ability to be able to use several languages together in a workspace.

### Profiles:

> üöß This is being changed. Possibly looking at using [native profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles).
> 
> Ultimately, profiles will mainly be used to control which extensions are active. Possibly also for demo purposes

Symlink the `./product.json` file to:

* **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\VSCodium\product.json` or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\VSCodium\product.json`
* **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/VSCodium/product.json`
* **Linux:** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/VSCodium/product.json` or `~/.config/VSCodium/product.json`

## Micro

This is installed via Dropbear. I am not currently using any plugins, so there is nothing to do here.

## Vim

I should probably just not. Am I gonna not? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
