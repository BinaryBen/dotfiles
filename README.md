<strong>It is said that you are your dotfiles. Ergo, this is me. Welcome, make yourself at <code>::1</code>.</strong><br />
<sub>A very opinionated and modern take on `~/.files`. Aimed at creating a personalised standard experience across supported systems. Drop into a similar experience across desktops and servers (for container-based and remote development workflows mainly). Build your own dotfiles using all of the custom coded modules, or take only what you need.</sub>

* ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è &nbsp; **Superpowered DX** - bespoke git ( [gud](//github.com/binaryben/gud) ) and tmux ( [tux](//github.com/binaryben/tux) ) modules supercharge the development experience
* üêù &nbsp; **Lightweight Prompt** - powerline inspired segments (beeline; currently written in Bash, may move to Nim)
* ‚òÅ &nbsp; **Distributed files** - Support for Resilio synced drive
* ‚öôÔ∏è &nbsp; **Synced preferences** - Makes the dock and menu bar hide on every macOS computer with ease
* üîÄ &nbsp; **Cross platform** - Software is installed via Dropbear, a meta-package manager
* üßë‚Äçüíª &nbsp; **Modern tools** - Contemporary (faster, prettier, more intuitive) alternatives used in interactive shells
* ‚è™ &nbsp; **Graceful fallbacks** - Zsh, Nerd Fonts or other modern tooling unavailable? No problem!

## Quick start

## ‚ú® Modernise the Terminal

It is the 21st Century. We have [better ways of doing things](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix) now. Let's use them!

Most of these are installed via my Dropbear "droppings", however many are configured in this repo. Where it makes sense, the ~~legacy~~ POSIX commands have been aliased to use the modern equivilants instead, but only in interactive shells.

* Bat
* LSD
* Delta
* dust
* duf
* broot? (or LSD tree?)
* fd
* ripgrep
